    <h2>micro:bit BitBot</h2>

    <p>Some time ago, I had the pleasure of playing around with a <a href="https://microbit.org/">micro:bit</a>. These tiny open-source ARM-based embedded systems have 25 LEDs in a 5x5 matrix, Bluetooth LE capabilities, 2 programmable buttons, and many more <a href="https://microbit.org/get-started/features/overview/">features</a> <small>(I used the new version.)</small></p>

    <p>To practice using micro:bits, I made some simple programs and games utilizing the matrix display, including a gravity simulation and Space Invaders! Below is a video demo of the latter.</p>

    <video controls loop>

    <div class="center-text">
        <p><small>Space Invaders, without an audio. I could add that in the future.</small></p>
    </div>

    <p>Additionally, I had access to a <a href="https://4tronix.co.uk/blog/?p=2289">BitBot XL</a> to play around with. The BitBot is a robot that you can attach a micro:bit onto and control using pins found on both pieces of tech. The BitBot has a ton of features that I won't be listing here, so if you're interested, <a href="https://4tronix.co.uk/blog/?p=2289">click here</a> to learn more.</p>

    </div>

    <p>With both the micro:bit and BitBot, the number of outputs I could play around with increased significantly. Now what I was interested were the motors and the ultrasonic sensor.</p>

    <p>At first I played around with making the motors spin and detecting distances using the ultrasonic sensor. Once I was familar with it, I programmed the BitBot to drive in a straight line and turn when it detected something in front of it. Pretty neat, but if we wanted to control it?</p>

    <h2>Making use of Bluetooth LE</h2>

    <p>As previously mentioned, the mirco:bit has Bluetooth LE capabilities, which allows it to communicate with other micro:bits. Now this is huge as one could build a network of micro:bits for more complex use cases, such as remote controlling!</p>

    <p>Now with the BitBot, controlling it directly using the buttons on micro:bit attached to it would be quite difficult, as you would have to move with the BitBot in sync, as well as <em>boring</em>. At that point you might as well as move the BitBot yourself...</p>

    <p>This is where Bluetooth <small>(Bluetooth as in Bluetooth LE)</small> comes in. We can use another micro:bit that we will hold to communicate with the mirco:bit on the BitBot and tell it where to move. Well, specifically how it should move. As cool as a system where one could enter in coordinates for the BitBot would move to, 2 buttons are simply far too few inputs for the user experience to be even somewhat bearable.</p>

    <p>I'm pretty sure I lost the code <small>(:P)</small> but the first version of this remote control BitBot system used the left and right buttons as turning left and right and pushing both buttons at the same time as moving forward. The second version had the BitBot constantly move forward with the pushing of both buttons toggling its forward movement.</p>

    <p>After I had my fun with that, I moved onto something else a little more interesting...</p>

    <h2>BitBot ultrasonic radar...?</h2>

    <p>Yep. I wanted to make a radar system using the BitBot. And it could 100% facilitate one: it has a ultrasonic sensor that could measure distances as well as motors that can turn said sensor. Below is the system in action! I'm quite proud of it.</p>

    <video controls loop>
        <source src="/assets/bitbot-radar.webm" type="video/webm">
    </video>
    <div class="center-text">
        <p><small>Yes, the screaming and cries are intentional.</small></p>
    </div>

    <p>The programming behind it is quite simple and very beginner. The mirco:bit would initialize an array which would store if there was a detected object. Then the BitBot would spin 45 degrees, detect if anything was close using the ultrasonic sensor, and append 1 or 0 to the array if there was or wasn't.</p>

    <p>After spinning a full 360 degrees, it would loop through the array and light up the LED in the correct direction on the LED matrix if the value at the current index was 1. How does it know which index was which direction? I hard-coded it. It was more convenient that way. <small><em>*Shrug*</em></small></p>
