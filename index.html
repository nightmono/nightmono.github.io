    <h1>nightmono</h1>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my website!</p>

    <p>I'm mostly a Python and JS programmer but I'll poke some other languages here and there (not that I'm good at any of them). I code mostly random things that interest me and are within my capabilities. Stuff ranges from celluar automata to random CLI apps.</p>

    <p>Here are some projects I've worked on. <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h2>WireWorld</h2>

        <p>A online simulation (that you can visit right now!) of the WireWorld celluar automaton.<br>This celluar automata is especially interesting because it's meant to simulate circuits and wires.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h2>Pomodoro Timer</h2>

        <p>My very first JavaScript project, a pure HTML/CSS and JavaScript copy of a pomodoro timer app, <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">pomofocus.io</a>.<br>This project was what taught me the basics of HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h2>Shunting Yard Algorithm</h2>

        <p>Infix notation to postfix notation parser. Pretty much essential in compliers.<br>Don't worry, I had no clue what infex and postfix notation was either.</p>
